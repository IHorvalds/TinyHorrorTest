# TinyHorrorTest

Test implementation of a tiny terror using JUCE.

For this, I'm using Will Pirkle's header files from [Addendum 19 of his book on audio effects.](https://www.willpirkle.com/fx-book-bonus-material/chapter-19-addendum/)

I've only played a bit with the values; I haven't tried to match the Tiny Terror's actual values.

**MASSIVE ALIASING ISSUES. Oversampling 8x doesn't seem to help. Still looking for a fix.**
